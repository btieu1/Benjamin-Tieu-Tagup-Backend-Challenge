# Benjamin-Tieu-Tagup-Backend-Challenge

Thanks for considering me for this position! I had a good time coding this up and learning a bit more about Python servers. 

## Some notes

Here, I will explain everything submitted. 
- Dockerfile: installs the dependencies listed in requirements.txt and sets up enviorment as well as makes image which listens on localhost:8080.
- exercise.py: the meat and bones of the project. You can find the source code here
- templates: i went a little fancier and used html if you were going to view the server on a web browser. Nothing too special, just some basic things. 
- client.py: I used the same samples that were provided to test with the client.py to send requests to the server. Most of the things in client.py are commented out.

Thank you for your consideration and have a nice day!
